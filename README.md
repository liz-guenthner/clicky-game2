## Overview

Clicky Pup Game is a memory game build with React. The application's UI is broken up into components, the components manage state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions

1. The application renders different pup images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's count and increments by one when unique image is clicked.

3. If the user clicks all 12 images without repeating, the count goes to 0, the score goes to 1 and a winning message appears.

4. The user has to start the game over if an image is clicked more than once (per game). If an image is clicked more than once, the count goes to 0 and a losing message appears.
